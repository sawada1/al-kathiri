          This is some placeholder content to show a vertically
           centered modal. We've added some extra 
           copy here to show how vertically
            centering the modal works when combined with 
            scrollable modals. We also use some repeated line breaks to 
            quickly extend the height of the content, thereby triggering the scrolling. 
            When content becomes longer than the predefined max-height of modal, 
            content will be cropped and scrollable within the modal.
